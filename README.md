# Introduction #
This repository contains code I made while playing around with the Croduino Basic3 which is a part of the Croduino Baisc Kit (CBK) Hobby available at [e-radionica.com](https://e-radionica.com/en/croduino-beginner-kit-cbk-hobby.html)

## Description ##
Attempts are made to make the code readable. This repository aims at exploring what the Basic3 is capable of.
